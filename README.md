# PSMILES - Fun with PüôÇs strings

The `psmiles` Python package provides tools and functions to work with polymer SMILES (PSMILES or PüôÇs) strings. PSMILES strings are a chemical language to represent polymers.

## PSMILES strings

PSMILES strings are string representations of polymer structures. A PSMILES string has two star (`[*]` or `*`) symbols that indicate the two endpoints of the polymer repeat unit and otherwise follows the daylight SMILES syntax defined at [OpenSmiles](http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html). See [PSMILES guide](https://www.polymergenome.org/guide/) for more details.

Examples:

 Polyethylene | Polyethylene oxide | Polypropylene |
|-|-|-|
| `[*]CC[*]` | `[*]CCO[*]` | `[*]CC([*])C` |
| ![](docs/PE.png) | ![](docs/PEO.png) | ![](docs/PP.png) |


## How to use `psmiles`


Create an object of the class `PolymerSmiles` for your PSMILES string. The object has functions to compute properties or manipulate the PSMILES string. For example, canonicalize a PSMILES string with

```python
from psmiles import PolymerSmiles as PS

ps = PS("C(c1ccccc1)(C[*])[*]")
ps.canonicalize
```

See the [Documentation](https://psmiles.readthedocs.io/) for more. Also, check out [`test_book.ipynb`](https://github.com/Ramprasad-Group/psmiles/blob/main/tests/test_book.ipynb) for examples.
